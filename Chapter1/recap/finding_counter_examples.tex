\textbf{Finding Counter Examples}

\textbf{1-1.} \emph{Show that a + b can be less than min(a, b)}
  \begin{center}
  Let $a = -1, b = -1$ \\ 
  Then $a + b = -2, \; min(a,b) = -1$ \\
  $\therefore \exists \; a, b \in Z : a+b < min(a,b)$
  \end{center}
  

\textbf{1-2.} \emph{Show that a * b can be less than min(a, b)}
  \begin{center}
  Let $a = -1, b = 5$. \\
  Then $a*b = -5, \; min(a,b) = -1$\\
  $\therefore \exists \; a, b \in Z : a*b < min(a,b)$
  \end{center}

\textbf{1-3.} \emph{Design/draw a road network with two points a and b such that the fastest route between a and b is not the shortest route}
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzcd}
		A \arrow[rrd, "{D=6m, \;S=3m/s}"'] \arrow[rr, "{D=5m, \;S=1m/s}"] &  & C \arrow[rr, "{D=5m, \;S=.2m/s}"] &  & B \\
		 &  & D \arrow[rru, "{D=6m, \;S=3m/s}"'] &  & 
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{center}
Although the distance from A to B through C is shorter than going through D, road constraints limit the time it takes making the route through D faster despite it being longer.
