1-1: **Show that a + b can be less than min(a, b)**
	let a = -1, b = -1. Then a + b = -2, min(a,b) = -1 so there exist a & b such that a+b < min(a,b)


1-2: **Show that a Ã— b can be less than min(a, b)**
	let a = -1, b = 5. Then a*b = -5, min(a,b) = -1 so there exist a & b such that a*b < min(a,b)


1-3: **Design/draw a road network with two points a and b such that the fastest route between a and b is not the shortest route**
