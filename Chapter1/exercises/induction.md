__Prove__:  SUM{i=1,n}(i) = n(n+1)/2 for n >= 0, by induction
    
    Let n = 1. Then n(n+1)/2 = 1 = SUM{i=1,1}(i) :.
    Assume that SUM{i=1,n}(i) = n(n+1)/2 for numbers <= n and  n >=0 
    SUM{i=1,n + 1}(i) = n+1 + SUM{i=1,n}(i)
                      = n+1 + n(n+1)/2
                      = (n+1)(n+2)/2 which we needed to show :.

__Prove__:  SUM{i=1,n}(i^2) = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6 for n >= 0, by induction
    
    let n = 1. Then n(n+1)(2n+1)/6 = 1 = SUM{i=1,1}(i^2)
    Assume that SUM{i=1,n}(i^2) = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6.
    SUM{i=1,n + 1}(i^2) = (n+1)^2 + SUM{i=1,n}(i^2)
                        = (n+1)^2 + n(n+1)(2n+1)/6
                        = (n+1)[6(n+1) + n(2n+1)] / 6
                        = (n+1)[2n^2 +7n + 6] / 6
                        = (n+1)(n+2)(2n +3) / 6
                        = (n+1)(n+2)(2(n+1) + 1) / 6 which we needed to how :.
