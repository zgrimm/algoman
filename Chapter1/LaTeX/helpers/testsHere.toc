\contentsline {paragraph}{{\color {answer}{}Although the distance from A to B through C is shorter than going through D, road constraints limit the time it takes making the route through D faster despite it being longer. }}{2}% 
\contentsline {paragraph}{{\color {answer}{}The route from A through C to B has only two turns but is a total length of 14 units while the direct route from A to B (the shortest) has 4 turns and is a length of 6 units. $\therefore $ The shortest route between A and B is not the route with the fewest turns. }}{2}%
