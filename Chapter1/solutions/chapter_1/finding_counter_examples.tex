{\color{answer}{}
\begin{align*}
	&\text{Let } a = -1, b = -1 \\
	&\text{Then } a + b = -2, \; min(a,b) = -1 \\
	&\therefore \exists \; a, b \in \mathbb{Z} : a+b < min(a,b) 
\end{align*}}

\quad\textbf{Ex:1-2.} \emph{Show that a * b can be less than min(a, b)}
%
{\color{answer}{}
\begin{align*} 
	&\text{Let } a = -1, b = 5. \\
	&\text{Then } a*b = -5, \; min(a,b) = -1\\
	&\therefore \exists \; a, b \in \mathbb{Z} : a*b < min(a,b)

% \textbf{1-6.} \emph{\textbf{The set cover problem is as follows: } Given a set of subsets $S_{1}, ..., S_{m}$ of the universal set 
% $U = \{1, ..., n\}$, 
% find the smallest subset of subsets 
% $T \subset S$ 
% such that  
% $\cup_{t_{i} \in T}t_{i} = U$ For example, there are the following subsets, $S_{1} = \{1, 3, 5\}, S_{2} = \{2, 4\}, S_{3} = \{1, 4\}, \; and \; S_{4} = \{2, 5\}$ The set cover would then be $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ . } \\
% \emph{\textbf{Find a counterexample for the following algorithm:} Select the largest subset for the cover, and then delete all its elements from the universal set. Repeat by adding the subset containing the largest number of uncovered elements until all are covered.}
% {\color{answer}{}
% \begin{align*}
% 	&U = \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11\}, \\
% 	&S_{1} = \{1,2,3,4,5\}, \; S_{2} = \{6,7,8,9\}, \; S_{3} = \{6,7,10\}, \; S_{4} = \{8,9,11\} \\
% 	&U^{'} = \{6,7,8,9,10,11\}, \; T^{'} = S_{1} \\
% \end{align*}
% The Set with largest number of uncovered elements is $S_{2}$. $S_{3}$ and $S_{4}$ must also be included in the set cover because they contain elements (10 \& 11 respectivly)
% in U that are not members of any other subset. Therefore this algorithm gives us as the set cover all of the subsets, but $S_{1} \cup S_{3} \cup S_{4}$ covers U and is smaller
% than $S_{1} \cup S_{2} \cup S_{3} \cup S_{4}$}
