\textbf{Stop and Think: Basic Priority Queue Implementatons} \\

\emph{Problem: What is the worst-case time complexity of the three basic priority queue operations (insert, find minimum, and delete minimum) when the basic data structure is:}\\

\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{An unsorted Array}
	\item \emph{An sorted Array}
	\item \emph{A balanced binary search tree}
\end{itemize}
